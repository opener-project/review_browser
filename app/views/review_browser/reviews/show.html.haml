        I stayed on this Hotel for 3 nights. The hotel looks modern superficially.
        But the service and breakfast in particular are in big question mark.
        <span class="topic">My bed sheets were not changed</span>, <span class="topic">the room was not cleaned very well</span>, except for <span class="topic">the bathroom, which was very clean</span>.
        As this hotel caters for large overseas bus groups there were long time
        consuming lines at reception. The hotel is a long way from the city centre,
        only one restaurant nearby, so your only option is to take the metro to
        get anywhere. Fortunately, the metro is 5 minutes away.
        Casa 400 has a business model: rooms appear as cheap when you want to
        book, but you have to take into account that breakfast is not
        included (â‚¬15). Want to have your breakfast in the vicinity? Good luck.
