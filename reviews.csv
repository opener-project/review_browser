Booking a short time before we could not find any hotels with a lower price.The new structure is as I said.

For example there is no hair dryer in all rooms, but you have to ask for it.The reception delivers it for free but they have a tot: if dovessere be all out is likely to remain with wet hair.The hotel is clean and it deserves a 7.Nothing more. Who gave scores above probably has never seen facilities and services.Condinuando with the description:good cleaning, wi-fi, safe (in-room safe and unrestricted access to the lifts only with the magnetic key of the room), carpet in the bedrooms, bathrooms poorly lit.

They have not surrendered a map, did not indicate the means closer, they did not say a word nor upon our arrival to our departure.Never mind, we were informed, but they sure were not professional.The rooms have all the mattresses, though neighbors. If you want a single mattress or rather a single duvet must pay 10 Û more (you get but also a kettle and tea bags).You can safely save Û 10. The beds are still attached.The hotel is far from downtown, close to the metro station Amstel.To remember that the quickest way to get to the station is behind the hotel through the steps.

Given the TripAdvisor reviews I had high expectations but was disappointed.

The shower lacked water pressure to the extent that only 30% of my body could get under the water at one time Ð IÕm an average size. Around the plastic hand basin were two cigarette butt burn marks (room 625); I appreciate they are not the fault of the hotel but they need to be sanded and polished out; there were no tissues. Trams run near the hotel for much of the night; whilst the hotel appears new and has double glazing the soundproofing (perhaps in the walls) is insufficient such that you can hear the rumble as trams pass by.

I took exception to this additional charge of 4.60 euros as my receipt listed ÒTaxes and FeesÓ and quoted a ÒTotal PriceÓ. In my view it is not acceptable to quote a total price, bank the money and then for the customer to be hit with an additional unexpected charge that was not previously mentioned. The front desk personnel were polite and helpful but lacked the authority to correct this basic problem. The staff in the restaurant plentiful but spent their time talking amongst themselves instead of providing a good service.

We travelled to the hotel from Schiphol airport using the regional train to Amsterdam Centraal station, and then taking the Metro to the hotel. Although the Casa 400 isnÕt in the centre of Amsterdam it is only about 7 minutes away on the Metro and the trains run very often Ð about every 4 or 5 minutes. We found it to be very convenient and the Metro was very easy to use once we realised you have to check in and out through the gates marked ÔMetroÕ and not the ones marked ÔTrainÕ, otherwise you get trapped in at the other end and it wonÕt let you through the barriers!Check in at the hotel was very easy and quick for us. However, lots of times we passed the reception and there were lots of people waiting. The queue didnÕt seem very organised by the hotel either. Be aware that there is a 5% city tax (that all Amsterdam hotels charge) which wasnÕt included in our pre-booking and we had to pay upon arrival. Our room was very basic, but a good size, bright and appeared clean (although the carpet could have done with a good hoover as when we reached onto the floor to pick up a dropped remote control our hands were dirty and we found a hair grip).  The beds werenÕt particularly comfortable, but werenÕt bad enough to ruin our nightÕs sleep. The room contained a safe, large enough to hold a 17Ó laptop and also a fridge which meant that we could buy drinks and food and keep them cool. We took a travel kettle with us and the Amstel railway station close by has a small Albert Heijn store from which we were able to buy fresh milk. The television could receive BBC1,BBC2 and BBC3 and BBC World News, although these werenÕt always reliable and  the picture disappeared for a few days in the middle of our stay! The bathroom contained a shower (which was nothing special) and a large sink and toilet. One day during our stay the bin in our room wasnÕt emptied, but this was sorted immediately after a quick call to reception who sent a cleaner up. The WiFi is free and varied between being fast and slow depending on the time of the day. The hotel offer a service where you can prebuy tickets to certain Amsterdam museums at reception. Unfortunately this was unavailable when we were there as the receptionist was unable to access the system. However, because of the free wifi that is available in the hotel, we were able to book our own tickets online and email them to reception. They promptly printed these out for us, which meant that we were able to save over an hour queuing at the Van Gogh museum and the Anne Frank house!There is a room on each floor which has an iron available for people to use. There are no hairdryers provided, but you can borrow one from reception. There is some building work going on close to the hotel at the moment, but ear plugs are available for free at reception. In our experience though, the noise was nothing at all to worry about! There is an ice dispenser available for free on some of the floors of the hotel. There are 4 lifts in the hotel, but this didnÕt seem enough at busy times of day as often the lifts took a long time to arrive or were full when they did!As mentioned earlier, the hotel is situated close to Amstel station, which means you can take the Metro straight into the centre. In addition, the Number 12 tram also stops at the station Ð this means you can be at the Museum Quarter in 15 minutes. The location was perfect for us, as it was away from the hustle and bustle of the centre, but close enough to be able to get swiftly to the places we wanted to on the Metro and Tram. There is an expensive restaurant on the ground floor and a bar on the first floor which serves simple snacks and meals.

The aforementioned chairs, however, were horribly uncomfortable- fine enough for sitting it to put on your shoes, but not for long periods of time. If you're the type of traveler who just uses your room to sleep in, this is a great choice, but if you plan to spend lots of time in your room, you may want to consider somewhere else.",6.0,4.0,4.0,,,2.0,GerhardSchutz,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",TripAdvisor,2011-08-19"Minimalist, no character, and poor service","I was in Amsterdam for business, and spent a week at the CASA.  Way too long to be there.Its new, clean, and bright, but its more like student accommodation.The rooms are small and boring, but there is free wifi throughout - rather frustrating that you have to re-authorize your device each time you go from one hotspot to another (e.g. room to bar or lobby), so with a smart phone you think you are connected but not really.Breakfast is like a mad house free for all and was often out of fresh hot food items, whole fruits, and juices.Food and service in the bar restaurant were both mediocre and hit and miss.  The bar/restaurant manager was good.Its a pity but it seems that Amsterdam hotels survive on short stay tourists and conventions at the Rai - neither of which demand a good level of service.I will not stay at the CASA in future.",6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,David H,"Denver, Colorado",TripAdvisor,2012-09-14"Our car and another five cars got broken into, won't be coming back","Unfortunately our car and another 5 five cars got broken into. We paid for privilege of having our car secured in the hotel underground car parking yet it got broken into. They have security cameras all over the place, I wonder how this happened?, We were given our room back for the rest of the day but they wanted us to leave ASAP, never mind you and your family traveling all the way back to your home country with a provisional window glass.

(my card used for the booking)We were then lied about their politics, have left us paid for two nights and then gently taken the first night.THEY ARE THIEVES IS EXTREMELY BADOther details:The service is the bare minimum, the towels are not changed evenThis hotel is far from downtown, planning transport and train station if you want nightlife budget, then it's hell to get ",2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,sarra m,"Strasbourg, France",TripAdvisor,2011-08-18There is a thief amongst the staff,"I had a parcel delivered to the hotel. After being told about the rigorous process that is followed when a package is delivered (i.e filing etc), I was told by the manager on duty that a member of her staff had signed for the parcel. Only to be told that they have no idea where is was. The next day a different manager refused to acknowledge that the parcel had been received. Staff should be searched, and managers hired should have more integrity. Absolutely disgusted with the manner in which this was handled. Clearly they assume ownership of goods once delivered. Don't make this mistake. Spend a little more money, knowing your belongings won't be stollen by the staff at reception!!",6.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,Tesantha N,"Johannesburg, South Africa",TripAdvisor,2012-08-22"good location, poor quality room","Asked for working safe and working fridge, but never got fridge fixed or replaced.
